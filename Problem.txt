Create an application that works like a shopping cart system for an online book store. To the left you will find a file named BookPrices.txt. This file contains the names and prices of various books, formatted in the following fashion:


I Did It Your Way, 11.95
The History of Scotland, 14.50
Learn Calculus in One Day, 29.95
Feel the Stress, 18.50


Each line in the file contains the name of a book, followed by a comma, followed by the book’s retail price. When your application begins execution, it should read the contents of the file and store the book titles in a ListView. The user should be able to select a title from the list and add it to a “shopping cart,” which is simply another ListView control. The application should have buttons or menu items that allow the user to remove items from the shopping cart, clear the shopping cart of all selections, and check out. When the user checks out, the application should calculate and display the subtotal of all the books in the shopping cart, the sales tax (which is 7 percent of the subtotal), and the total.
